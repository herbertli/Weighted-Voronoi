              Given a set of point-sized stones of various colors,
              a Weighted Voronoi diagram is a tesselation of a plane into colored regions
              such that every point with integer coordinates (x, y) has the color of the stones that
              give it the greatest pull.

              Graviational Voronoi is a n player game that works as follows:
            </Text>
            <ul>
              <LText>
                n players are each assigned a color, and are each allocated W units of weight
              </LText>
              <LText>
                Each player can distribute their allotted weight across a maximum of S stones on a 500x500 board.
              </LText>
              <LText>
                The first player places one stone, then the second player places one stone and so on...
              </LText>
              <LText>
                Each player places one stone until all players have placed S stones or have exhausted all their weight.
              </LText>
              <LText>
                If a player cannot place a stone (either they have used all of their weight or placed all of their stones),
                their turn is skipped
              </LText>
              <LText>
                Additionally, every stone must be a Euclidean distance of at least d units
                away from any other stone.
              </LText>

              The pull for a color c at point p with coordinates (x, y) is calculated as follows:
            </Text>
            <Text paragraph>Supposing that color c has k stones placed:</Text>
            <ul>
              <LText>
                Take all k stones and compute their Euclidean distances to point p
                say d1, d2, ... dk.
              </LText>
              <LText>
                Take the weights of all k stones w1, ..., wk
              </LText>
              <LText>
                pull(c, p) = (w/(d1*d1)) + (w/(d2*d2)) + ... + (w/(dk*dk)).

            </ul>
            <Text paragraph>
              It's as if we're computing the color of a point based on the color that gives
              the greatest pull.
